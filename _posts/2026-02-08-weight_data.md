I have recently been on a kick of losing weight and lifting. I have a lot of data from my smart scale, which I use every morning. I decided to whip something quick up as a first step to a possibly larger effort around visualizing weight and calorie data. Below are the graphs I was able to make today.

To pull it all together, I have put my first commit up on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/griffin-rickle/askesigraph) in the askesigrpah repo. It's still pretty rough, but I thought it was pretty cool and a fun little Sunday project (to fill the gaps where I wasn't chasing little ones around)
